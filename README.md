# AskWise-AI-Gemini-Powered-Conversational-Assistant
Love this stage btw 😄
When you start asking **“what should I name it + README?”**, you’ve officially moved from *coding* → *building real products*.

Since your app is:

* Streamlit UI
* Gemini powered
* Conversational Q&A
* knowledge assistant
* quick demos / AI chat

Let’s give it a **clean + professional + portfolio-friendly** name (not something cringe like “chatbot123” 😂).
